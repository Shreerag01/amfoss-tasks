# TASK-07

I am having trouble with the reset function. When I press the reset button, it displays "go!" instead of returning the value "0". I still haven't been able to figure out the error in my code. Even after trying various approaches for the reset function, the result remains the same. I have attached a screen recording of its functioning.
