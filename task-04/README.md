# TASK-04

I found this task to be exciting because I had previously only used a Telegram bot to search for movies, but had not explored the programming aspect of it. This task gave me a better understanding of how a Telegram bot works, including how it retrieves movie information from the OMDB website. While I encountered some difficulties in writing the data to a CSV file, I was eventually able to get the bot running smoothly. I have attached a screen recording of the bot functioning.
